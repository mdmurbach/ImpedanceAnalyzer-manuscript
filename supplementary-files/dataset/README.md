# Dataset files

This directory contains the raw data files (`/raw_data`) as well as the
compiled impedance dataset (`38800-Z.csv`) used in the ImpedanceAnalyzer
tool and in the analysis for the manuscript.

The input parameter ranges are found in `parameter-ranges.txt` and `param-ranges-for-saltelli.txt` and the final file used for creating the dataset are stored in `model_runs.txt`.

A final compiled file with both the parameter inputs and the impedance simulation
outputs can be found in `full_dataset.csv`.
