### Code and analysis for ImpedanceAnalyzer manuscript
------------------------------------------------------

The ImpedanceAnalyzer is an open-source, web-based analysis platform aimed at making physics-based models as easy to use as equivalent circuits for the analysis of experimental EIS spectra.
[This repository](https://github.com/mdmurbach/ImpedanceAnalyzer-manuscript) contains all of the data and code used in the first manuscript about the tool.

**Please cite the following paper if you use this code:**

#### Software dependencies
---------------------------

The code in this repository has been tested with the following versions of software:

- Python 3.6.3 [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)
- Conda 4.3.30 (through Miniconda3) [https://conda.io/miniconda.html](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
- Git Bash on Windows

The environment.yml file can be used to recreate the same conda environment with the following commands:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

`source activate ImpedanceAnalyzerManuscript`

COMSOL v4.4 and LiveLink for MATLAB (2013b) were used to run the impedance simulations.
