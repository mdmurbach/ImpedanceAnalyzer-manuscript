### Code and analysis for ImpedanceAnalyzer manuscript
------------------------------------------------------

The ImpedanceAnalyzer is an open-source, web-based analysis platform aimed at making physics-based models as easy to use as equivalent circuits for the analysis of experimental EIS spectra.
[This repository](https://github.com/mdmurbach/ImpedanceAnalyzer-manuscript) contains all of the data and code used in the first manuscript about the tool. To cite this repository: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/109768401.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/109768401)
